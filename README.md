# FaceRecognitionApp

● Used Clarifai Image Recognition API to detect a face in an image and display a box around it. 

● Built the front end with Create React App and connected it to the back end using the Fetch API. 

● Created a RESTful API server with Node.js and Express.js that interacts with a PostgreSQL 
database using Knex.js storing user information securely, making it a fully working application. 

● Deployed the front end to production using Netlify and the back end to Heroku.
